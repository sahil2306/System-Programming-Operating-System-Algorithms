# System Programming & Operating System Algorithms:

This repository contains different algorthims used in System Programming:
1) Assembler: For converting instructions written in low-level assembly code into relocatable machine code and generating along information for the loader (Pass1 and Pass2)
2) Lex Token: Lex is a tool or a computer program that generates Lexical Analyzers (converts the stream of characters into tokens)
3) Lex Count: To count number of Lines, characters as well as words
4) Program Scheduler: Different PRogram Schedulers in Java
